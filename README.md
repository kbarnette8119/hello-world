# All About Me

# <p> My name is Kristie and I live in the United States. I am interested in computers and coding but this is the first computer class I am taking. 

# I am taking it to decide if I should pursue a career in computers.  I currently work in law enforcement but I am interested in changing careers.

----------- I started getting interested in the computers because I was assigned a project at work and it was and is still a nightmare.  The project has been a disaster from the start because it was poorly handled at every level.  ---------- The project was the purchase of a new record management and computer-aided dispatch software. I have had to learn many, many, many things about the world of computers and I really enjoy it.

====  <p> I am a wife to one and mother of four.  We live in a middle-class neighborhood and live a pretty normal life. I love my wife incredibly much, my family and my friends and try to be the best version of myself I can be. I struggle at times but always try and reflect on my actions and the consequences. I believe in tipping whenever you can because such a small gesture most often brings happiness and sharing in the wealth of my life, love, family and good fortune seems like a small price to pay.
